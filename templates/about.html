         <h3>Phase One: Requirement Analysis</h3>
         <p>During the requirement analysis phase, the project's scope and objectives are clearly defined. This involves gathering functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders, understanding user needs, and identifying potential risks. The goal is to establish a detailed Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document that outlines what the software should accomplish, ensuring alignment between business goals and technical execution.</p>

   </div>

   <div class="timeline-block timeline-block-left">
      <div class="marker"></div>
      <div class="timeline-content">
         <h3>Phase Two: Design</h3>
         <p>In this phase, the software's architecture and design are created based on the requirements gathered. This includes system design, database design, and user interface design. High-level design focuses on the system’s architecture, while detailed design looks at modules, data flow, and algorithms. The objective is to provide a blueprint that guides developers on how to implement the system efficiently.</p>

   </div>

   <div class="timeline-block timeline-block-right">
      <div class="marker"></div>
      <div class="timeline-content">
         <h3>Phase Three: Development</h3>
         
         <p>The development phase involves writing the actual code for the software. This is where developers follow the design specifications to create functional modules and integrate them. The code is usually developed in iterations, following the chosen software development methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall). Collaboration between front-end, back-end, and database developers ensures that the software meets the design and requirement standards.</p>

   <div class="timeline-block timeline-block-left">
      <div class="marker"></div>
      <div class="timeline-content">
         <h3>Phase Four: Testing</h3>
         
         <p>Once the development is complete, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any defects or bugs. This phase includes different levels of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). The aim is to ensure that the software is reliable, performs as expected, and is free of critical issues before being released to users.</p>

      <div class="timeline-content">
         <h3>Phase Five: Deployment and Maintenance</h3>
         
         <p>In this phase, the software is deployed to a production environment where end-users can start using it. This includes setting up the necessary infrastructure and performing any final configurations. After deployment, the maintenance phase begins, where the software is monitored for bugs, performance issues, and feature enhancements. Updates and patches are released as needed to improve the software and ensure its long-term viability.</p>
